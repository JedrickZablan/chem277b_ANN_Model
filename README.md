# Project Description

This repository contains the final project for CHEM 277b: Machine Algorithms, focused on developing a supervised learning Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model applied to the ANI-1 dataset. The project involves progressive development with regular check-ins to ensure steady progress and thorough documentation. Key milestones include data preparation, network construction, and regularization strategies with hyperparameter tuning. This repository includes a detailed Jupyter notebook documenting all stages and an individual report comparing the model's results with those reported in the literature. The report covers the introduction, methods, results, and discussion, providing a comprehensive overview of the project's workflow, findings, and conclusions.
